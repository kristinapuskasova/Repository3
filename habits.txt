1. Programming is a physically demanding activity
    - good exercise and good sleep are crucial, one has to sit straight, drink enough fluids, go out often and get some sunshine
    - I think this can be applied to any sedentary job in general, it is important to take care of our body and get many short breaks 

2. Have a 'get-it-done' attitude
    - instead of focusing on small problems that are actually not so important, such as environment configuration, or refactoring of the code until it is spotless, try to focus on the overall goal and keep things moving 
    - it is fun to play around with details in general, but it should not be at the expense of efficiency  

3. Keep it simple
    - don't be arrogant! keep the code as simple and consistent as possible, showing off will always eventually backfire no you  
    - I think it is important to keep in mind that programmers are a team pursuing the same goal, and in a healthy team an individual's capabilities should be well appreciated so there's no need for bragging

4. Have a consistent way to get in the zone (productive time)
    - explain to others that you need a specific undisturbed period of time
    - I believe that each colleague will understand as they need their undisturbed time as well

5. Always learn, get out of your comfort zone
    - learning new things is essential, one has to understand how different systems are put together in different environments in order to be able to debug
    - this approach will ensure that you don't fall into a routine and feel outdated

6. Collaboration
    - programming is a 'team sport' and your code must integrate with other people's code
    - don't be afraid to ask for help, someone might have dealth with the same issue already, collaboration boosts productivity

7. Get used to spending time alone
    - get ready for the fact that you won't socialize that much as a programmer
    - I think this can be resolved by spending all of your free time with your family, friends, colleagues etc. (plus, when you work from home, you can get a dog who will keep you company)
