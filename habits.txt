1. Programming is a physically demanding activity
    - good exercise and good sleep are crucial, one has to sit straight, drink enough fluids, go out often and get some sunshine
    - I think this can be applied to any sedentary job in general, it is important to take care of our body and get many short breaks 

2. Have a 'get-it-done' attitude
    - instead of focusing on small problems that are actually not so important, such as environment configuration, or refactoring of the code until it is spotless, try to focus on the overall goal and keep things moving 
    - it is fun to play around with details in general, but it should not be at the expense of efficiency
